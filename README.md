## Development

*Counterfeit Monkey* is currently being developed in Inform 7 6G60. We intend to update it to 6M62 in the near future.

If you want to work on the code on Windows but have installed a later version of Inform 7, we recommend the [Portable 6G60 App](http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2472#p35583).
